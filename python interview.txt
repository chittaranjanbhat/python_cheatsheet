5. what is Deep Copy
The deep copy method creates independent copy of an object. If we edit the element in a copied object, that does not affect the other object

6.How do you copy an object in Python?
In Python, the assignment statement (= operator) does not copy objects. Instead, it creates a binding between the existing object and the target variable name. To create copies of an object in Python, we need to use the copy module

7. What is the difference between Shallow Copy and Deep Copy
Shallow Copy is a bit-wise copy of an object. The copied object created has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If either of the values are references to other objects, just the reference addresses for the same are copied.
Deep Copy copies all values recursively from source to target object, i.e. it even duplicates the objects referenced by the source object.
